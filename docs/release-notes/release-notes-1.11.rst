Updates

``paas-charm``

Support for custom COS directories

and Prometheus alert rules through custom COS directories.

RabbitMQ HA support

A new ``RABBITMQ_CONNECT_STRINGS`` environment variable is now available for

* `Pull request #230 <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/230>`_

Use ``ops.charm_dir`` instead of ``os.getcwd``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications using ``paas-charm`` can now run scenario tests correctly.
The framework now uses ``ops.charm_dir`` to locate charm configuration files
instead of relying on ``os.getcwd()``.

* `Pull request #241 <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/241>`_

Structured logging and trace correlation for FastAPI (Uvicorn)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FastAPI applications now support structured logging in JSON format via Uvicorn.
When the application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry, trace context is
automatically correlated in both access and error logs. The logging format
can be configured using the ``paas-config.yaml`` file.

* `Pull request #255 <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/255>`_

Structured logging and trace correlation for Django and Flask (Gunicorn)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django and Flask applications now support structured logging in JSON format
via Gunicorn. When the application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry, trace
context is automatically correlated in both access and error logs. The logging
format can be configured using the ``paas-config.yaml`` file.

1.11.1 patch release — 17 March 2026
------------------------------------

``paas-charm`` bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The custom COS directory was previously being merged on every charm event,
causing unnecessary overhead. It is now merged only once, skipping the
operation if the merged directory already exists.

* `Pull request #256 <https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/pull/256>`_
